To compile the program
- gcc client.c -o client
- gcc server.c -o server

To run the program
- ./client
- ./server

Type exit keyword in the user input to exit the program. The server will display the no of lines that it received and the total number 
of digits received. The same functionality can be achieved by pressing the Ctrl+C on the server side.
If the message contains both C00l and exit then I am just exiting the code and not considering the input as a secret code
