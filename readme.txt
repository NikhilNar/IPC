To compile the program
- gcc receiver.c -o receiver
- gcc processor.c -o processor

To run the program
- ./receiver
- ./processor

Type exit keyword in the user input to exit the program and check the secrets.out file.
If the message contains both C00l and exit then I am just exiting the code and not considering the input as a secret code
